# Coding Template
File template for creative coding, with focus on p5.js.

## Imitate, Integrate, Innovate
In general, we will be using an "imitate, integrate, and innovate" design process to understand and creatively extend new code:

Together, these three steps represent a process of starting with existing coding techniques and strategies, building upon them by combining them with other elements, and ultimately introducing new or original ideas to create something innovative. By following this process, we can learn, integrate, and extend new coding techniques and strategies in a way that is both grounded in proven concepts and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

### Imitate
To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.

Pick one or more of the examples I've provided and get it working for yourself. Change whatever you need to get it working.

Document this process by saving screenshots of steps in the process.

### Integrate
After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.

Extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new.

Document this process by saving screenshots or taking code snapshots at various steps in this process. 

### Innovate
Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.

Use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel.

Document this process at various steps in the process.

### Reflect
Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Include:

* What part of the project you contributed
* A reflection on your work and and the work of the team
* Brief highs and lows

The reflection portion of each lab will be an important part of the assignment where you tell about your experience performing the experiment, describe any problems you had, solutions you developed, and epiphanies you experienced.

## About Experiment 3: Alternate Worlds
Below are the 2 worlds created as part of experiment 3.
[Overworld Glitch Project](https://plains-biome-tilemap.glitch.me)
[Dungeon Glitch Project](https://purple-tilemap-dungeon.glitch.me)
### Overworld
This autotile map features a grassy plains biome in conjucntion with water.
The land/plains/grass is represented as "?" and the water as "O".
### Dungeon
There are 2 rooms in this dungeon connected via a tunnel/passage way. The rooms are represented as: "?" and ":".
The tunnels are represented as "|" and "_".
