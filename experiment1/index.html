				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I created a generator on glitch.com which was then integrated into this webpage. The generator itself creates a silly recipes which can be generated over and over gain using the "Re-roll recipe" button. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Essentially, a recipe template is created with certain words missing that are filled in using replacer(). Replacer takes a word from a selected word bank and replaces the specified "missing word".</p>
				
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Initially I wanted to be able to use a randomly "replaced" word more than once. But since the replaced words were randomized with each use of replacer(), I was unable to do so easily. I attempted to make a global variable to store the word, but it did not work. I believe if I spent more time on this issue I could have found a solution. I lack some knowledge of how to debug JS in this instance. The generator itself works find and does what I wanted it to do. The only issue I ran into during this experiment was incoporating the glitch.com generator. The newlines did not work properly, thus I needed to research a solution. I found one from stack overflow and used "white-space: pre-wrap;"</p>
