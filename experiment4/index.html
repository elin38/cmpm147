				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, my goal was to create a landscape resembling Il Mheg from Final Fantasy XIV (there is a photo at the bottom). The features of this landscape include pink ground littered with grass, tall crystal structures, and trees. Below you will find a refrence photo.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I store user clicks in 3 separate object arrays: one for crystals, one for trees, and one for grass. The clicks are stored in one of the arrays depending on the key the player is holding down. By default, clicks are stored as grass, as trees if the T key is held, and as crystals if the C key is held down. Finally, when we draw the world, we look to see where these objects are in terms of their tile and we draw them. Additionally, trees, crystals, and grass are generated naturally via an algorithm that uses the world seed alongside a modulus.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Personally, I really like how the world looks. I am especially happy with the way the crystal towers came out, nice and colorful. Also, as with the other two experiments, the interactiveness and agency the user has is something I really like. Being able to interact with the experiment is something I really enjoyed implementing. For a baseline experiment, I am happy with how it turned out. If I were to improve this, I would have to add a little more sparatic life, perhaps a fairy or creature to roam this world.

				<h2>Statement</h2>
				<p>
					Infinity
					<br>
					The world goes on for every in every 2-D direction. See this by using the arrow keys.
				</p>
				<p>
					Variation in Space
					<br>
					As the player explores, they will see crystals surrounded by rainbows, trees, and grass.
				</p>
				<p>
					Variations in Key
					<br>
					Different world generations will have different spreads of the aforementioned landmarks. Additionally, the color gradient will be slightly different.	  
				</p>
				<p>
					Signs of Life
					<br>
					Clicking on tiles will allow players to create their own worlds using the provided landmarks. Also, notice the blowing wind on the trees and grass.
