				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>My goal with this experiment was to create a game. I drew a little bit of inspiration from "never king" in terms of making an interactive game where you move a character. I decided to make a treasure-hunting game since I believe that with a grid world, it would be easy to give coordinates for the player to follow. So as you can see, the top right gives coordinates to the treasure, the mouse tile tells you where you are, and the bottom right counts how many treasures you have collected. For this experiment, I really focused on combining the best parts of the previous experiments into 1. For instance, I took the world generations of Part 1 and combined it with the character movement of Part 2.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Both the world generation and player movement are similar to Part 1 and Part 2 respectively. Using a hash value combined with noise and modulus for random terrain, and a draw/location function to move the character. When it comes to the actual game mechanics, I have the treasure initially spawn within a 10-tile radius of the player's start (0, 0). Then, every time the player reaches/collects a treasure, it is placed again within a certain radius of the player (at random). Finally, these values are all held in variables, thus it is easy to print them out for the player to use.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					In a similar fashion as Part 2, I am very happy with how interactive the game is. I am especially satisfied with the theme and creativity of this game. It reminds me a lot of snake and the fact that it is infinite makes it really interesting. Additionally, I just like how everything I worked on kind of came together into this last Part. Some of the ways I believe this could be improved is to add some animation or effects whenever a treasure is collected, perhaps a ripple or sparkle.

				<h2>Statement</h2>
				<p>
					Infinity
					<br>
					The world goes on for every in every 2-D direction. See this by using the arrow keys.
				</p>
				<p>
					Variation in Space
					<br>
					As the player explores the world, they will notice trees, grass, and the very occational treasure chest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Variations in Key
					<br>
					A different key means a different starting placement of the treasure chest. It also means slightly different sand patterns and placements of initial trees and grass.
						  
				</p>
				<p>
					Signs of Life
					<br>
					Move the shovel by clicking on the tiles. Collect treasure by moving the shovel to the provided coordinates. Watch the wind blow trees and grass.
